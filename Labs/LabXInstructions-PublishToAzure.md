## Publish Your Web App to Azure

Follow the steps in the [lecture notes](http://lcc-cit.github.io/CS296N-CourseMaterials/LectureNotes/CS296N-LN-WK0XDX-PublishingToAzure.html) to create a database via the Azure web portal and to publish your web app using Visual Studio.

### Check Your Resource Usage

After your app has been running for at least one full day, check your credit balance.
Some of you need to check your credit balance one way and some the other way. The two ways are:
1. By going to the https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/ web page and checking it there.
2. By going to https://azure.portal.com and clicking your name in the upper-right corner, then clicking the three dots, then the menu option: "View My Bill."

Take a screen-shot that shows your credit balance.

## Review and Submission

No code review is needed.

### Production Version

- In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment paste a link to your web app running on Azure.
- Upload the screen-shot of your credit balance.
