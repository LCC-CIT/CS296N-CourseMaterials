## Publish Your Web App to Azure

Follow the steps in the [lecture notes](http://lcc-cit.github.io/CS296N-CourseMaterials/LectureNotes/CS296N-LN-WK0XDX-PublishingToAzure.html) to create a database via the Azure web portal and to publish your web app using Visual Studio.

### Check Your Resource Usage

After your app has been running for at least one full day, go to the [Azure Sponsorships](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/) web page, click on "Usage Details". From this page, download a spreadsheet readable file of the your resource usage by selecting "CSV" and clicking the button near the upper-right corner of the web page. 

## Review and Submission

No code review is needed.

### Production Version

- In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment paste a link to your web app running on Azure.
- Upload your resource usage file.
