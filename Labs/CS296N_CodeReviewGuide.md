###  Instructions

The reviewer will complete this form for the beta version of a lab assignment done by one of their lab partners. After filling out the “Beta” column and adding comments, the reviewer will submit this document to the Code Review assignment on the LMS.

The developer will revise the beta version of their lab work and fill out the “Production” column to reflect any changes they have made. The developer will submit this completed form along with the production version of their lab assignment.

### Review

Add explanatory comments in the row following any "no" answers.

## Appendix

### Aspects of coding style to check

- Is proper indentation used?
- Are the HTML elements and variables named descriptively?
- Have any unnecessary lines of code or files been removed?
- Are there explanatory comments in the code?
- Do variable names use camelCase? 
- Are properties, methods and classes named using PascalCase (aka TitleCase)?
- Are constant names written using ALL_CAPS?



### Best practices in Object Oriented Programming

- Is the code DRY (no duplicated blocks of code)?
- Are named constants used instead of repeated literal constants?
- Is code that does computation or logical operations separated into its own class instead of being added to the code-behind?
- Are all instance variables private?
- Are local variables used instead of instance variables wherever possible?
- Does each method do just one thing (no “Swiss Armey” methods)?
- Are classes “loosely coupled” and “highly coherent”?
