# Lab 6 â€“ Load Testing

CS296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET

## Objectives

Get practice:

- Creating a JMeter test plan
- Running a JMeter test
- Viewing load test results
  - Creating a report
  - Creating a graph



## Instructions

1. Download the JMeter app from [https://jmeter.apache.org](https://jmeter.apache.org/) and unzip it.

2. Create a test script.

   - Record a test script using JMeter as a proxy.
     - Include logging in and logging out.
     - Open each page of your web site.
     - Do a search, if your site supports searching.

   - Modify the test script to manage the antiforgery token on the login page.

4. View the test results.
   - View the summary report and take a screen-shot
   - View the graph and take a screen-shot
