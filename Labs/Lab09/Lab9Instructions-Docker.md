Gain experience:

- Creating a Docker image.

- Running a web app in a Docker container.

- Deploying a container to Azure

  

## Part 1. Docker Exercises

Read the Docker [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide, parts 1, 2 and 3. Do all the steps that can be done on your development machine. 

Your grade on this part will be based on self-reporting:

- "Read it": 7 points
- "Did part of it": 8 points
- "Did it all" (Performed all the steps): 10 points



## Part 2. Containers for Your Own App

- Create a git branch named Lab9-Docker.
  (You won't be writing any new code, but this branch will contain your dockerfile, a new publish profile, and any changes you might make to your appsettings.json or launchsettings.json files)
- Publish your app to a folder on your development machine. Your app should be using a SQL database on Azure. 
- Add a Dockerfile to the solution folder of your web app and add the appropriate commands to the file.
- Build a Docker image and create a  container for your web app.
- Deploy the container to Azure.
- Merge this lab's Git branch into the master branch, but don't delete the lab branch.
