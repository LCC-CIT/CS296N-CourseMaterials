# Lab 2 â€“ Identity and Admin Pages

CS296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET



## Objectives

Learn how to:

-   Add Identity to a web app.

-   Set up administrative pages for managing users.

## Instructions

### Part 1, Textbook Tutorial

Build the web site described in Ch. 28 of Pro ASP.NET MVC 2. Follow the author's instructions to create a new project from scratch and either type or copy and paste the code from the book into the new project. 

In the section, "Using ASP.NET Core Identity", starting on page 890, it might be easiest to copy and paste the files from the completed exercise into your project.

#### Reporting

Report what you did for this exercise by entering the appropriate phrase in the online text of the Moodle assignment:

- "Ran it", means you downloaded and successfully ran the completed code.
- "Studied and ran it", means you successfully ran the completed code, but put in breakpoints and examined what was happening at all the critical points in the code.
- "Coded it and ran it", means you added the code as shown in the textbook, studied it, and got it to run successfully.

### Part 2, Your Web Site

-   Create a new branch named *Lab2-Identity* based on your lab 1 branch.

-   Add Identity to your web app&mdash;use the same database as the one used by your application. (**don't** create a separate DbContext class as shown in the Sports Store example in the textbook.)

-   Your user model will need to inherit from the IdentityUser class and will need to have some properties of its own. You can choose the properties, just don't duplicate the ones already in IdentityUser.

-   Add the same administrative pages as those added in the Part 1 exercise. These are the pages for:

    -   Creating users
        -   Validating passwords
        -   Validating user names
        -   Validating e-mail addresses
    -   Editing user information
    -   Listing users
    -   Deleting users
    
- Add links to navigate between your admin pages. 

- Write a document titled *lab2-Identity.md*, or .txt that lists the features and web pages added Put this in a folder named *docs* in the top level of your lab repository.

  

## Review and Submission

### Code Review

1. Send a pull request to another student asking them to review your code. 

   After you have finished revising your code, you can merge it into the master branch, but keep the lab branch, don't delete it.

2. You should get a pull request from the other student and review their code.

   In the "online text" field of the Code Review assignment on Moodle, enter the URL of the pull request you responded to.

### Production Version

1.  In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment:
    - Report of what you did in part 1.
    - Paste a link to your GitHub repository and branch for part 2.
2.  Upload the code review document containing a review of your code.
