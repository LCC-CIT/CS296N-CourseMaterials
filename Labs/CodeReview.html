<h1>Code Reviews</h1>
<p>In the "real world", most code reviews are done by the other members of your development 
team in response to a pull request from your working branch in the team Git repository. 
You will follow 
a similar workflow for your lab assignments. </p>
<h2>Create a repository on GitHub</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Create one private 
	repository for all your lab assignments in this class.<br>GitHub now offers <a href="https://github.com/pricing" target="_blank">free 
	private repositories</a> with up to three collaborators. </li>
	<li>&nbsp;Add your instructor and your lab partner as collaborators. <br>You can 
	restrict them to read-only priveledges if you wish.</li>
	<li>You will create two branches for each lab assignment, a beta branch and 
	a production branch. <br>The weekly lab instructions will provide guidance for 
	naming the branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lab work-flow</h2>
<ol>
	<li>To facilitate grading, create two branches for each lab assignment. <br>For 
	example, branches for lab 1 might be:<ul>
		<li>Lab1-Master</li>
		<li>Lab1-Beta</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Put any starting files in Lab1-Master.<br>Starting files might be:<ul>
		<li>Files provided by your instructor</li>
		<li>The finished version of your previous lab assignment</li>
		<li>An empty project with default files created by the IDE</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Do your lab work, making frequent commits to the Lab1-Beta branch.</li>
	<li>When your beta version is done, send a PR with Lab1-Master as the base being compared to Lab1-Beta.<ul>
		<li>Reminder: you can only send a PR if the code on the two branches is 
		different.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make revisions to your code on Lab1-Beta after getting a review from your 
	lab partner.</li>
	<li>Merge Lab1-Beta into Lab1-Master.<br>Lab1-Master is now the production 
	version for this lab assignment and this is what you will submit to your 
	instructor.</li>
</ol>

instrucitons with screen-shots</a>.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<ul>
	<li>PRs need to be sent by the due date shown on Moodle or in the syllabus.<ul>
		<li>Your lab partner is not obligated to give you a review if your PR is 
		sent late.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Code reviews need to be given by the date shown on Moodle or in the syllabus.<ul>
		<li>Code reviews given after the due date for the lab assignment won't be 
		accepted for grading.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What if my lab partner doesn't send me a PR?<ol>
		<li>Attempt to contact your lab partner and ask them to send a PR.</li>
		<li>If your lab partner has still not sent a PR, contact your instructor.<ul>
			<li>Your instructor may be able to send you a PR for an alternate project 
			to review.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>What if my lab partner doesn't review my code?<ul>
		<li>If you feel confident about your beta version, you can just go ahead 
		and merge your code and submit it.</li>
		<li>If you still want a review, you can contact your instructor to either 
		give you a review or arrange for someone else to give you a review.</li>
	</ul>
