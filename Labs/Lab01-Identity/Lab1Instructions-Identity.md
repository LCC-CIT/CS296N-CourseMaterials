# Lab 1 â€“ Identity

CS296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET

## Objective

Learn how to add Identity to a web app.

## Instructions

### Part 1, Textbook Tutorial

Do the first 10 steps of exercise 16-1 in *Murach's ASP.NET Core*.

Do steps 8 through 10 first.

For steps 1 through 7, in addition to inspecting the code, set a breakpoint in each of the locations described and run the app so that it hits the breakpoint. Think about the sequence of events that led to hitting each breakpoint to help you better understand the purpose of each block of code.

#### Reporting

Report what you did for this exercise by entering the appropriate phrase in the online text of the Moodle assignment:

- "Didn't do it"
- "Studied it": Carefully studied the code in the book to understand it. 5/10
* "Ran and studied it": Downloaded the code, put breakpoints in relevant methods and experimented with the code to understand how it works: 7/10
* "Did it all": Downloaded the exercise start and did all the steps in the exercise: 10/10

### Part 2, Your Web Site

-   Make a new repository. Copy the source code for the final version of your web app from last term into a new repository and create a Lab01 branch.
-   Add Identity to your web.
-   Modify the seed data to work with the Identity UserManager.
-   Add a Registration page to your web app.



## Review and Submission

### Beta Version Code Review

1. Send a pull request to another student asking them to review the beta version of your code. 

   After you have finished revising your code, you can merge it into the master branch, but keep the lab branch, don't delete it.

2. You should get a pull request from the other student and review the beta version of their code.

   In the "online text" field of the Code Review assignment on Moodle, enter the URL of the pull request you responded to.

### Production Version

1.  In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment:
    - Report of what you did for part 1.
    - Paste a link to your GitHub repository and branch for part 2.
    - Optional: paste a link to your site running on a web server.
