# Lab 1: Validation of User Input

For all three types of web sites, add validation using data annotations to your models. Use validation that makes sense for the properties you choose to validate.

-   Create a new branch named *Lab1* based on your master branch.
-   Add validation to at least six properties from any of your models.
-   Use at least three different validation attributes.
-   At least one property should have more than one validation attribute.



## Review and Submission

### Code Review

1. Send a pull request to another student asking them to review your code.

   After you have finished revising your code, you can merge it into the master branch, but keep the lab branch, don't delete it.

2. You should get a pull request from the other student and review their code.

   In the "online text" field of the Code Review assignment on Moodle, enter the URL of the pull request you responded to.

### Production Version

1.  In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment:
    - Report of what you did in part 1.
    - Paste a link to your GitHub repository and branch for part 2.
2.  Upload the code review document containing a review of your code.
