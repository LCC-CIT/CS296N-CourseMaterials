    <h1>Code Reviews</h1>
    <p>In the "real world", most code reviews are done by the other members of your development team in response to a pull request from your working branch in the team Git repository. You will follow a similar workflow for your lab assignments. </p>
    <h2>Create a repository on GitHub</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create one private repository for all your lab assignments in this class.<br>GitHub now offers <a href="https://github.com/pricing" target="_blank">free 
	private repositories</a> with up to three collaborators. </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Add your instructor and your lab partner as collaborators. <br>You can restrict them to read-only priveledges if you wish.</li>
        <li>You will create two branches for each lab assignment, a beta branch and a production branch. <br>The weekly lab instructions will provide guidance for naming the branches.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Lab assignment work-flow</h2>
    <h3>Working with Git and sending a pull request</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To facilitate grading, create two branches for each lab assignment. <br>For example, branches for lab 1 might be:
            <ul>
                <li>Lab1-Master</li>
                <li>Lab1-Beta</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Put any starting files in Lab1-Master.<br>Starting files might be:
            <ul>
                <li>Files provided by your instructor</li>
                <li>The finished version of your previous lab assignment</li>
                <li>An empty project with default files created by the IDE</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Do your lab work, making frequent commits to the Lab1-Beta branch.</li>
        <li>When your beta version is done, <strong>send a PR</strong> with Lab1-Master as the base being compared to Lab1-Beta.
            <ul>
                <li>Reminder: you can only send a PR if the code on the two branches is different.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make revisions to your code on Lab1-Beta after getting a review from your lab partner.</li>
        <li>Merge Lab1-Beta into Lab1-Master.<br>Lab1-Master is now the production version for this lab assignment and this is what you will submit to your instructor.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Doing a code review</h3>
    When you get a PR from your lab partner, you will follow these steps to revie their code:
    <ol>
        <li>Clone your lab partner's repository to your development machine, if you haven't already done so.</li>
        <li>Pull the branch specified in the PR</li>
        <li>Run the code to test it. Check to see if it meets all the requirements for this lab assignment.</li>
        <li>Inspect the code to check for good coding practices</li>
        <li>Provide the review in the PR comments section on GitHub</li>
    </ol>

instrucitons with screen-shots</a>.</p>
    <h2>Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PRs need to be sent by the due date shown on Moodle or in the syllabus.
            <ul>
                <li>Your lab partner is not obligated to give you a review if your PR is sent late.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Code reviews need to be given by the date shown on Moodle or in the syllabus.
            <ul>
                <li>Code reviews given after the due date for the lab assignment won't be accepted for grading.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What if my lab partner doesn't send me a PR?
            <ol>
                <li>Attempt to contact your lab partner and ask them to send a PR.</li>
                <li>If your lab partner has still not sent a PR, contact your instructor.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your instructor may be able to send you a PR for an alternate project to review.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>What if my lab partner doesn't review my code?
            <ul>
                <li>If you feel confident about your beta version, you can just go ahead and merge your code and submit it.</li>
                <li>If you still want a review, you can contact your instructor to either give you a review or arrange for someone else to give you a review.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
