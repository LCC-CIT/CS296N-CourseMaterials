# Lab 4 â€“ Authorization and Admin

CS296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET

## Contents

[TOC]

## Objective

Learn how to authenticate a user and authorize user access to different sections of a web app based on user roles.

## Instructions

You will add all the same Authorization and Administration features to your web site that your instructor added to the example web site:

- Two roles of your choice.
  
  - One for all registered users.
  - Another for administrators.
  
- Restrict some part of the web site to only be accessed by registered users.

- Add a page for user and role management. 
  The operations on this page will be:

  - Delete user
  - Add to Admin
  - Remove from Admin
  - Delete role

- Restrict access to the management page to administrators.

  - You will need to seed the database with a user who is in the Admin role in order to be able to access the management page for the first time.

  

### Extra Credit

1. Add the account and admin views that are in the textbook example, but that we didn't cover in class:
   - Add User
   - Access Denied

2. Add a link for the admin page to the navigation menu that only appears when a user in the Admin role is logged in.



## Review and Submission

### Code Review

1. Send a pull request to another student asking them to review your code. 

   After you have finished revising your code, you can merge it into the main branch, but keep the lab branch, don't delete it.

2. You should get a pull request from the other student and review their code.

   In the "online text" field of the Code Review assignment on Moodle, enter the URL of the pull request you responded to and gave another student a code review.

### Production Version

1.  In the "online text" for the Moodle assignment:
    - Paste a link to your GitHub repository and branch for part 2.
    - Paste a link to your site running on Azure (or another web host).
