# Code Review Checklist

Refer to the <a href="http://lcc-cit.github.io/CS296N-CourseMaterials/Labs/StyleAndBestPractices.html" target="_blank">C# coding style and best practices guide</a> while doing code reviews. Enter "Yes" or "No" in the square brackets. For any items with a "No", add a description of the problem. Remember that you don't need to review the entire web app, just the new code or changes made for the current lab assignment.
