## Objective

Learn how to authenticate a user and authorize user access to different sections of a web app based on user roles.

## Instructions

### Part 1, Textbook Tutorial

Finish exercise 16-1 in *Murach's ASP.NET Core* by doing steps 11 through 28.

#### Reporting

Report what you did for this exercise by entering the appropriate phrase in the online text of the Moodle assignment:

- "Did it all" means you completed all the steps, studied the code (setting breakpoints to help you understand the execution flow), and ran the app.
- "Inspected and ran it" means that you downloaded the completed app, studied the code (setting breakpoints to help you understand the execution flow), and ran the app.
- "None of the above" means you didn't do the exercise

### Part 2, Your Web Site

You will add all the same features to your web site that your instructor added to the example web site.

### Authentication

Add Authentication code to your lab web site for each of these features:

- Registration
- Login
- Logout
- Use the currently logged in user in any place where a user previously needed to enter their name.

### Authorization

Add code for these authentication features to your web app:

- Two roles of your choice.
  - One for all registered users.
  - Another for administrators.
- Restrict some part of the web site to only be accessed by registered users.
- Add a page for user and role management.
- Restrict access to the management page to administrators.

  

## Review and Submission

### Code Review

1. Send a pull request to another student asking them to review your code. 

   After you have finished revising your code, you can merge it into the master branch, but keep the lab branch, don't delete it.

2. You should get a pull request from the other student and review their code.

   In the "online text" field of the Code Review assignment on Moodle, enter the URL of the pull request you responded to.
