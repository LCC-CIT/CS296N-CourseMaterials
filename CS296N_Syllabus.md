## Assessment and Grading

Specific grading criteria will be applied to each of the labs, quizzes, and exams you will be working on in this class. Part of the lab involves a code review. Attendance is not graded.
The table below summarizes the grade distribution for each of the learning and assessment activities:



| Activity     | Percentage of grade |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Labs         | 40%                 |
| Code Reviews | 10%                 |
| Quizzes      | 10%                 |
| Term Project | 40%                 |


Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

|      | -        |         | +       |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A    | 90 - 91  | 92 - 97 | 98-100  |
| B    | 80 - 81  | 82 - 87 | 88 - 89 |
| C    | 70 - 71  | 72 - 77 | 78 - 79 |
| D    | 60 - 61  | 62 - 67 | 68 - 69 |
| F    | Below 60 |         |         |



### Late Work

- The grade for lab assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.

- Quizzes cannot be taken after the due date.

- Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://inside.lanecc.edu/copps/documents/no-show-drops) policy which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must attend at least one class meeting or complete one assignment or quiz.
