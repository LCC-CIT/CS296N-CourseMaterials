## Introduction

- Q and A

## Review - Authentication

In the last two classes, we added these features to the BookReivew app:

- New user registration
- Login
- Logout

## Overview

We will use Delamater and Murach (2020) as a guide to adding authentication to our web app. We'll discuss both the "how" and the "why" as we do it.

## Example Code Repositories

[BookReivew, Lab03 branch](https://github.com/LCC-CIT/CS296N-Winter2021LabExample/tree/Lab03)&mdash;2021 example

[BookInfo, Authentication branch](https://github.com/ProfBird/BookInfo-WebApp-Core3/tree/Authentication) &mdash;User login and logout controller methods and views from 2020.
