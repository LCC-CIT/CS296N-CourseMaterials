## More ASP.NET Topics

There are some other topics we skipped this term, as well as things I would have liked to include. We might be able to fit them in during the capstone class next term.

- Consuming a web API using C# (server-side).
- Ajax
- Security
- User file upload (pictures, videos, etc.)
- Use a combo-box (drop-down list with text input field) to enter (with autocomplete) or select items from a database to facilitate consistency of items entered or selected.
- Send e-mail to users.

## Debugging and Code help

Time to do some screen sharing and look at people's code.
