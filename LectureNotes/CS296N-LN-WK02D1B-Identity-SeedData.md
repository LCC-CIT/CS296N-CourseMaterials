## Identity UserManager

When we added Identity to our project, we removed the `DbSet` for our user from our`DbContext` class. This is because the user table in the database is now managed by Identity. Instead of using the DbContext to do CRUD operations with our AppUser model, we will do all of those operations using the Identity `UserManager` service.

### Adding a User in Seed Data with the UserManager

As an example of how to use the UserManager service, we will refactor our SeedData to use the UserManager.

1. Modify the code in Program.cs that calls the `SeedData.Seed method` to pass in an instance of `IServiceProvider` which is needed in order to get an instance of `UserManager`

```c#
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var context = scope.ServiceProvider
      .GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();
    SeedData.Seed(context, scope.ServiceProvider);
}
```

2. In the SeedData.Seed method, add code to get a UserManager object.

   ```c#
   public static void Seed(ApplicationDbContext context, IServiceProvider provider)
   {
      // code omittted 
      var userManager = provider
        .GetRequiredService<UserManager<AppUser>>();
   ```

3. Create users with the UserManager.

   ```c#
    const string SECRET_PASSWORD = "Secret!123";
    AppUser emmaWatson = new AppUser { UserName = "Emma Watson" };
    var result = userManager.CreateAsync(emmaWatson, SECRET_PASSWORD);
   ```

## Footnotes

*CreateScope* is a method that creates a new scope for the specified service provider. It is used to create a new scope for resolving dependencies. The IServiceScope instance returned by CreateScope is used to resolve dependencies within the scope of the created scope. The IServiceScope instance is also used to dispose of the scope and any resources that were created within it when it is no longer needed. 

*Scoped services* are registered using the AddScoped method of the IServiceCollection interface. When a scoped service is requested, a new instance of the service is created within the scope of the current request. The same instance is then used for all subsequent requests within that same scope.
