## Identity UserManager

When we added Identity to our project, we removed the `DbSet` for our user from our`DbContext` class. This is because the user table in the database is now managed by Identity. Instead of using the DbContext to do CRUD operations with our user model, we will do all of those operations using the Identity `UserManager` service.

### Adding a User in Seed Data with the UserManager

As an example of how to use the UserManager service, we will refactor our SeedData to use the UserManager.
