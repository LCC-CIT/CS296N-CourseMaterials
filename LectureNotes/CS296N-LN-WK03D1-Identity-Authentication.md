### Review User Registration

Last time we added user registration to our web app by adding the following:

- A view-model: RegisterVM
- A view: Registration
- Methods in the AccountController:
  - HttpGet version of Register
  - HttpPost version of Register



## Overview

We will use Delamater and Murach (2020) as a guide to adding authentication to our web app. We'll discuss both the "how" and the "why" as we do it.



## Adding Authentication to Our Web App

### Login and Logout 

#### Modify the navbar

Page 665, "How to add Log In/Out buttons" and links to the layout.
Note: add a register button as well.

##### Using DI with views

Page 568 describes this.

Normally it's not a good practice to inject dependencies into views, but since a layout doesn't have a controller method to pass it a model, this is an acceptable solution.

The @Inject directive does the same thing for a view that adding a parameter to a controller does for a type for which a DI service is defined in startup.

#### Login

Pages 674&ndash;679 describe the process of adding login

- ViewModel
- View
- Controller methods

### Updating code that uses `AppUser`

Since we refactored our user domain model, now named `AppUser`, to inherit from `IdentityUser` we need to change the way we use the user model in some of our code.

#### Saving new reviews in the database

This is done in the *Post* version of the `Review` method in the `BookReviews` controller:

```c#
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Review(Review model)
{
    model.ReviewDate = DateTime.Now;
    // Store the model in the database
    if(ModelState.IsValid)
    { 
        repo.AddReview(model);
    }
    return View(model);
}
```

##### Getting a `Reviewer` model from Identity

The Review model contains an `AppUser object named Reviewer:
(Validation annotations removed for clarity)

```c#
public class Review
    {
        public int ReviewID { get; set; }
        public string BookTitle { get; set; }
        public string AuthorName { get; set; }
        public AppUser Reviewer { get; set; }
        public string ReviewText { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReviewDate { get; set; }
    }
```

The Reviewer object is currently being supplied by the Reivew.cshtml view. We need to get it from Identity instead. We'll do this by refactoring the *Post* version of the `Review` method in the `BookReviews` controller:



##### Getting the current user

 To get the current user, simply use the `User` property of the controller to get an object that identifies the current user, then use `GetUserAsync` to get the `AppUser` object:

```c#
  model.Reviewer = userManager.GetUserAsync(User).Result;
```

```c#
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Review(Review model)
{
    // Get the AppUser object for the current user
    model.Reviewer = userManager.GetUserAsync(User).Result;
    // TODO: modify the register code to get the user's name
    model.Reviewer.Name = model.Reviewer.UserName;  // Temporary hack
    model.ReviewDate = DateTime.Now;
    // Store the model in the database
    repo.AddReview(model);
    return View(model);
}
```
