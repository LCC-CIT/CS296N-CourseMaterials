## Web Services


An ASP.NET Core Web API (aka web service) can be used in several ways: 	

1. As a way to add AJAX to Razor views to make them more efficient.
    		The reservation web app in Ch. 20 of Freeman (2017) is an example of this.

2. As a way to create a web service.

   - Think of a web service as a web site that doesn't have a UI, it is meant to be accessed by a computer not a human. 
- You can also think of it as an API that contains methods that can be called over a network or over the Internet. 		
   
There are two main scenarios in which web services are used: 		
   
1. To facilitate a [Service Oriented Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) in which different components of a system communicate over a network.
   2. To provide a service that can be used by third parties or subscribers.

- Advantages of using web services: 		
  - Allows computing services to be distributed across: 			
    - Multiple machines
    - Any distance
  - Provides a service that is: 			
    - OS independent
    - Language independent
- Types of Web Services 		
  - SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol 			
    - An older protocol that is more difficult to implement and consume.
  - REST - Representational State Transfer 			
    - A newer type of web service that is easier to implement and consume. It is being used for most new web service implementations.

## REST Architecture

- Not really a new protocol - just uses HTTP
  Example: [Weather Underground REST API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs)

  `http://api.wunderground.com/api/0e3e69302fba4e56/conditions/q/CA/San_Francisco.json` 		

  ### Representations

- Resources - a REST service provides access to resources, which can be any kind of digital object: image, video, text, etc.

- There is no restriction on the way resources can be represented, but the two most common means are:

  - JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
  Example:
    
    ```json
      {
            "response": {
              "version": "0.1",
                "termsofService": "http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/terms.html",
                "features": {
                    "conditions": 1
                }
            },
            "current_observation": {
                "image": {

  - XML - eXtensible Markup Language
    Example:
    [Weather forecast for San Francisco](San_Francisco.xml)
### Messages


- Messages from the client are [HTTP Requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_message)

  - Verbs can be: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD.

- A request should only affect one resource. (Each resource should have at least one URI.)
- Messages from the service are [HTTP Responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Response_message)
- Each message is independent - RESTful services are stateless

## Consuming a REST Service

### Web Service Clients

- Can be written in any programming language

- Can run on any OS

- Normally integrated into other software (many apps include code that calls a web service)

- Can run on any type of platform - server, browser, mobile app, etc. 

- Server-side client code can be written in any language that runs on the server, but
  - Browser client code has traditionally been written in JavaScript and may use a framework like jQuery or React.
  - In the past, browser extensions allowed client code in other languages; like Silverlight which was programmed in C#.
  - With the advent of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (Wasm), client code can be written in any language that can be compile to Wasm; like C# and the client-side [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) framework.

  ### Web Service Testing

- [SoapUI ](https://www.soapui.org) - for testing both SOAP and REST
  
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) - primarily for REST, but can also be used for SOAP
- [curl](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/curl.1.html) - Linux command to transfer a URL. Can be to test both SOAP and REST
