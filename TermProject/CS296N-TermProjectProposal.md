# CS296N Term Project Proposal

**Write a proposal for your web site that includes:**

1.  A written description of the site that is at least two paragraphs in length.
2.  A preliminary UML diagram of the domain model. (You will probably revise this as you develop your site.)
3.  A "site map", in the form of an outline, that shows how a user would navigate to each page in the site.
4.  UI wire-frames for each view (you don't need to include login, registration, and user administration if they are the same as those in the textbook). Use a drawing program like: Paint, [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings), [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com), [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) or some other computer drawing program.

Submit all of the above in one document. Please use a pdf or docx (Word) document and don't zip it. (so I can read it online in Moodle).
